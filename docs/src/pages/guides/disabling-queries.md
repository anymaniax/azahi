title: Disabling/Pausing Queries
---

If you ever want to disable a query from automatically running, you can use the `enabled = false` option.

When `enabled` is `false`:

- If the query has cached data
  - The query will be initialized in the `status === 'success'` or `isSuccess` state.
- If the query does not have cached data
  - The query will start in the `status === 'idle'` or `isIdle` state.
- The query will not automatically fetch on mount.
- The query will not automatically refetch in the background when new instances mount or new instances appearing
- The query will ignore query client `invalidateQueries` and `refetchQueries` calls that would normally result in the query refetching.
- `refetch` can be used to manually trigger the query to fetch.

```js
const queryResult = this.azahi.useQuery('todos', fetchTodoList, {
  enabled: false,
});
```
